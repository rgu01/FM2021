- These models are for reproducing the experimental results of paper "Model Checking Collision Avoidance of Nonlinear Autonomous Vehicle Models" for FM2021.
- Download UPPAAL STRATEGO from: https://people.cs.aau.dk/~marius/stratego/
- Run command: ./run.sh in Linux.
- The lib folder contains the library implementing a collision-avoidance algorithm based on dipole flow field
- Verification results will be printed in the folder named "results"
